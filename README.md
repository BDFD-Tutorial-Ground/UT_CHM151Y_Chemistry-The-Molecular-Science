An introductory course in physics for students intending to concentrate their future studies in the physical sciences, optometry, or mathematics; includes vectors (dot and cross products), particle kinematics and dynamics, forces in nature, work and energy, conservation of energy and linear momentum, rotational kinematics and dynamics, and conservation of angular momentum.

**Course prerequisite**

- [x] **C1-4U Calculus and Vectors**
- [x] **C2-4U Advanced Functions**
- [x] **C3-4U Physics**
      [Note: Successful completion of 4U Calculus and Vectors, 4U Advanced Functions and 4U Physics is required. Offered: F, also offered online: W]

**Course Learning Objectives**
The principles underlying this curriculum are shared by educators dedicated to the success of all students in learning mathematics. Those principles can be stated as follows:

- Curriculum expectations must be coherent, focused, and well-articulated across the grades
- Learning Mathematics involves the meaningful acquistion of concepts, skills, and processes and the active involvement of students in building new knowledge from prior knowledge and experience
- Learning tools such as manipulatives and technologies are important supports for teaching and learning mathematics
- Effective teaching of mathematics requires that the teacher understand the mathematical concepts, procedures, and processes that students need to learn, and use a variety of instructional strategies to support meaningful learning
- Assessment and evaluation must support learning, recongnizing that students learn and demonstate learning in various ways
